To interpret the distribution of Xmax we first imple-
ment an acceptance cut such that our set of showers is
not biased by selection effects. We first apply a cut in en-
ergy at E = 1017.5 eV, above which the SD trigger we use
to read out AERA is fully efficient [24, 25]. However, not
every trigger leads to a high-quality shower in AERA.
Hence, we next calculate the detection acceptance for
AERA by evaluating the reconstructability of the set
of 27 simulated air showers that were created for each
measured shower. We implement the condition that the
measured shower should have been detected if it had ar-
rived anywhere within the expected range of Xmax values
as predicted by simulations. Specifically, we require, for
any shower we select, that 90% of the Xmax values of
a Gumbel distribution for both protons and iron nuclei,
given the energy of the shower, would be reconstructable
by AERA. Removing the events that do not pass the ac-
ceptance cut results in 594 showers. Table I lists these
quality cut steps and the final distribution of events can
be seen in Fig. 4 (green shaded area). Fig. 8, as ex-
ample, shows the average acceptance (thick green line)
for all selected showers with energies between 1017.95 to
1018.10 eV and the average Gumbel distributions for the
energies of those showers under the assumption of a com-
position consisting of just protons (solid red), just iron
nuclei (solid blue), and the mixed-mass composition as
measured by Auger FD [40] (Gumbel parametrization for
QGSJetII-04 [41, 42] are used). At these energies AERA
is fully efficient up to about 850 g cm−2, after which the
efficiency drops slightly for the tail of the proton Gumbel
distribution. For the lowest energies this occurs around
800 g cm−2 (not shown).
