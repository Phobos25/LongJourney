Need to add tables for mid and high en

20181226
finished mid energy

20181225
finished lowest energy

20181224
almost finished lowest energy. need some extra motivation

20181223

starting to work on it again

20181015
done plotting. Started to create a table. look in the notebooks. You also need to try 2 more options on the shortlist

20181010
working on other issues

20181008
testing some things

20181005
same

20181004
test running

20181002
run some tests, apparently it's possible to have decent results if adjust it around ~150 m instead of 200m


20181001
just revising what to do and what I did before

20180930
working on data processing. Probably need to process raw data and 
create another method just for that. currently struggling with
createing DataForm, need to pass 2d array

20180929
working on other simulations. have problems with pd.read_csv
maybe use different type of reading or somehow convert the raw data
or maybe just read it normally and convert it to data frame or database


20180928
refactoring

20180927
без коррекции амплитуд для расстояний больше 200 м, получается значение 470
после 566
энергия до коррекции определяется более или менее правильно. 
наверное энергию можно было бы определить по амплитуда на другом расстоянии
при +/- 10 м получается 613 

TODO посмотреть для других энергий, только новую формулу (f)


20180926


получается, если подставить 75 и 225 м.
TODO подставь другую формулу и посмотри. подставил для углов 45 (f)
другие коэффициенты и получилось более или менее адекватные Xmax.


20180925
еще проверил, как будет влиять на хмакс, если изменять амплитуду туда сюда взависимости от ошибок (до 200м и больше 200)
лучше всего работает + до 200м, но все еще недостаточно, для нормальных значений. может надо другую формулу?
TODO добавить метод, который будет запускать всю эту писанину отдельно, входные данные x и y, массивы (f)
20180925 - проверил хмакс, получается все равно мало (проверка с + до 200)
20180924 - снова работа над моделью. составил план. начал гонять туда сюда
20180921 - работа над моделью
