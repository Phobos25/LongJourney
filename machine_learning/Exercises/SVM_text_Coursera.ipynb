    "Метод опорных векторов (Support Vector Machine, SVM) — один из видов линейных классификаторов. Функционал, который он оптимизирует, направлен на максимизацию ширины разделяющей полосы между классами. Из теории статистического обучения известно, что эта ширина тесно связана с обобщающей способностью алгоритма, а ее максимизация позволяет бороться с переобучением.\n",
    "\n",
    "Одна из причин популярности линейных методов заключается в том, что они хорошо работают на разреженных данных. Так называются выборки с большим количеством признаков, где на каждом объекте большинство признаков равны нулю. Разреженные данные возникают, например, при работе с текстами. Дело в том, что текст удобно кодировать с помощью \"мешка слов\" — формируется столько признаков, сколько всего уникальных слов встречается в текстах, и значение каждого признака равно числу вхождений в документ соответствующего слова. Ясно, что общее число различных слов в наборе текстов может достигать десятков тысяч, и при этом лишь небольшая их часть будет встречаться в одном конкретном тексте.\n",
    "\n",
    "Можно кодировать тексты хитрее, и записывать не количество вхождений слова в текст, а TF-IDF. Это показатель, который равен произведению двух чисел: TF (term frequency) и IDF (inverse document frequency). Первая равна отношению числа вхождений слова в документ к общей длине документа. Вторая величина зависит от того, в скольки документах выборки встречается это слово. Чем больше таких документов, тем меньше IDF. Таким образом, TF-IDF будет иметь высокое значение для тех слов, которые много раз встречаются в данном документе, и редко встречаются в остальных.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Данные\n",
    "\n",
    "Как мы уже говорили выше, линейные методы часто применяются для решения различных задач анализа текстов. В этом задании мы применим метод опорных векторов для определения того, к какой из тематик относится новость: атеизм или космос."

I would think that would be great _fun_, not having ever\\nfelt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze.\\nThis is not what I got when I believed - I just tried to hide my fear\\nof getting punished for something I never was sure of. The Bible is\\nhopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure. God did\\nnot answer. In the end, I found I had been following a mass delusion,\\na lie.

So .. ?\\n\\nI suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe\\nand analyse their position. In fact, it is amusing to note in this\\ncontext that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the\\nopposite - one should not examine one's belief critically.\\n\\nI'll tell you something I left out of my 'testimony' I posted to this\\ngroup two months ago. A day after I finally found out my faith is over,\\nI decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional\\nresponses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only\\na couple of hours.
