The Standard Model is a theory in particle physics that describes some of the most basic forces of nature. One fundamental particle, the Higgs boson, is what accounts for the mass of matter. First theorized in the 1964, the Higgs boson eluded observation for almost fifty years. In 2012 it was finally observed experimentally at the Large Hadron Collider. These experiments produced millions of gigabytes of data.

Large and complicated datasets like these are where deep learning excels. In this notebook, we'll build a Wide and Deep neural network to determine whether an observed particle collision produced a Higgs boson or not.
